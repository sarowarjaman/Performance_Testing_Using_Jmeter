Performance Testing with JMeter

This repository showcases my work on performance testing using Apache JMeter. It includes test creation, execution, result analysis, and report generation.
Features

    Test Plan Configuration: Well-structured test plans for performance evaluation.
    Automated Reporting: Generates reports on response times, throughput, and errors.
    Scalability Testing: Assesses system performance under different load conditions.

Tools and Technologies

    Apache JMeter: Used for designing and running performance tests.
    GitHub: For version control and collaboration.

Project Goals

    Assess Application Performance: Understand system behavior under load.
    Identify Bottlenecks: Detect areas causing slowdowns or failures.
    Optimize Efficiency: Ensure the system handles traffic effectively.

Repository Structure

    TestPlans/ - Contains JMeter test files (.jmx).
    Reports/ - Stores test results, including charts and tables.
    README.md - Project documentation.
